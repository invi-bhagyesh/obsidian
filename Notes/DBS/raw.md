**INTRODUCTION TO SQL**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Understand the working of DDL/DML commands.

SQL Statements can be categorized as -

DDL (Data definition language): Are used to define database structure or schema.

DML (Data manipulation language): Are used to change or alter data with the database

or schema.

DCL (Data Control Language): Are used to control access or privileges.

TCL (Transaction Control Language): Are used to manage transactions in the database.

**Basic Data Types used in SQL:**

 CHARACTER [(length)] or CHAR [(length)],

 VARCHAR (length)

 BOOLEAN

 SMALLINT

 INTEGER or INT

 DECIMAL [(p[,s])] or DEC [(p[,s])]

 NUMERIC [(p[,s])]

6 REAL

 FLOAT(p)

 DOUBLE PRECISION

 DATE

 TIME

 TIMESTAMP

 CLOB [(length)] or CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT [(length)] or CHAR

LARGE OBJECT [(length)]

datatype(<size>) ...);

**EXAMPLE:**

SQL>

create table STUDENT (

reg_no number (5),

stu_name varchar(20),

stu_age number(5),

stu_ dob date,

subject1_marks number (4,2),

subject2_marks number(4,2),

**INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS IN SQL**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Understand the use of integrity constraints.

**Integrity Constraints:**

Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table. These are used to limit the

type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data

in the database. Constraints could be column level or table level. Column level

constraints are applied only to one column, whereas table level constraints are applied to

the whole table.

Following are commonly used constraints available in SQL.

 NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.

 DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

 UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are different.

 PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

 FOREIGN Key: Uniquely identifies row/record in another database table.

 CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy

certain conditions.

Constraints can be specified when a table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement

or you can use ALTER TABLE statement to create constraints even after the table is

created.

**Dropping Constraints:**

Any constraint that you have defined can be dropped using the ALTER TABLE

command with the DROP CONSTRAINT option.

10For example, to drop the primary key constraint in the EMPLOYEES table, you can use

the following command:

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES DROP CONSTRAINT EMPLOYEES_PK;

**Integrity Constraints Syntax:**

 Ensure the uniqueness of the primary key(PRIMARY KEY)

column_name data_type primary key

 Primary key(column_name(s))

 Ensure the uniqueness of the candidate key which is not the primary key

column_name data_type unique

 Ensure that child records in related tables have a parent record.

foreign key(column_name) references table_name(column_name)

 Delete child records when the parent record is deleted.

foreign key(column_name) references table_name(column_name) on delete cascade

 Ensure that columns always contain a value.

column_name data_type not null

 Ensure that a column contains a value within a set/specific range.

check (column_name in (value1, value2,..))

check (predicate)

 Ensure that a default value is placed in a column.

column_name data_type default (value)

 Naming Constraints: Constraints can have unique user defined name as given below

CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> <constraint_definition>

Ex.: constraint account_pk primary key(account_number)

 To list constraints defined on the table:

Select * from user_cons_columns where table_name=’employee’;

 Modifying Constraints:

11ALTER TABLE <table_name>

ADD / MODIFY/DROP/DISABLE/ENABLE/VALIDATE/NOVALIDATE

CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>

**Built-in Functions:**

 **LENGTH (string):** The Oracle/PLSQL LENGTH function returns the length of the

specified string.

**Syntax:** LENGTH( string1 )

 **LOWER (string):** The Oracle/PLSQL LOWER function converts all letters in the

specified string to lowercase. If there are characters in the string that are not letters,

they are unaffected by this function.

**Syntax:** LOWER(string)

 **SUBSTR(string, start, count):**The Oracle/PLSQL SUBSTR functions allows you to

extract a substring from a string.

**Syntax:** SUBSTR(string, start_position [, length ] )

 **UPPER (string):**The Oracle/PLSQL UPPER function converts all letters in the

specified string to uppercase. If there are characters in the string that are not letters,

they are unaffected by this function.

**Syntax:** UPPER (string)

 **NVL (column name, substitute value):** The Oracle/PLSQL NVL function lets you

substitute a value when a null value is encountered.

**Syntax:** NVL (string, replace_with)

 **ROUND (value, precision):** The Oracle/PLSQL ROUND function returns a number

rounded to a certain number of decimal places.

**Syntax:** ROUND (number [, decimal places])

 **TO_CHAR (date1, format):** The Oracle/PLSQL TO_CHAR function converts a

number or date to a string.

12**Syntax:** TO_CHAR( value [, format mask] [, nls_language] )

 **LAST_DAY(date):**The Oracle/PLSQL LAST_DAY function returns the last day of

the month based on a _date_ value.

**Syntax:** LAST_DAY(date)

 **MONTHS_BETWEEN (date1, date2):**The Oracle/PLSQL MONTHS_BETWEEN

function returns the number of months between _date1_ and _date2_.

**Syntax:** MONTHS_BETWEEN (date1, date2)

 **NEXT_DAY(date1, ‘day’):**The Oracle/PLSQL NEXT_DAY function returns the first

weekday that is greater than a _date_.

**Syntax:** NEXT_DAY (date, weekday)

 **TO_DATE (string, ‘format’):**The Oracle/PLSQL TO_DATE function converts a

string to a date.

**Syntax:**TO_DATE( string1 [, format_mask] [, nls_language] )

**Ex:** to_date (‘12021998’, ‘DDMMYYYY’)

16**LAB NO.: 3 Date:**

**INTERMEDIATE SQL**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Understand the set operations and intermediate level queries.

**SET Operations in SQL:**

Multiple queries using the set operators **UNION**, **UNION** **ALL**, **INTERSECT**,

and **MINUS**. All set operators have equal precedence. If a SQL statement contains

multiple set operators, then Oracle Database evaluates them from the left to right unless

parentheses explicitly specify another order.

The corresponding expressions in the select lists of the component queries of a compound

query must match in number and must be in the same data type group (such as numeric

or character).

The **UNION** operator returns only distinct rows that appear in either result.

SELECT product_id FROM order_items

UNION

SELECT product_id FROM inventories;

The following statement combines the results with the **INTERSECT** operator, which

returns only those rows returned by both queries:

SELECT product_id FROM inventories

INTERSECT

SELECT product_id FROM order_items;

The following statement combines results with the **MINUS** operator, which returns only

unique rows returned by the first query but not by the second:

17SELECT product_id FROM inventories

MINUS

SELECT product_id FROM order_items;

**CREATE VIEW Statement**

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains

rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real

tables in the database.

**SQL CREATE VIEW Syntax**

CREATE VIEW view_name AS

SELECT column_name(s)

FROM table_name

WHERE condition;

**LAB EXERCISE:**

Implement the following Queries on UNIVERSITY Database:

**Set Operations**

**UNION (Use union all to retain duplicates):**

1. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 or in Spring 2010

**INTERSECT (Use intersect all to retain duplicates):**

2. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 and in spring 2010

**MINUS:**

3. Find courses that ran in Fall 2009 but not in Spring 2010

**Null values**

19**LAB NO.: 4 Date:**

**COMPLEX** **QUERIES** **ON** **SQL**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Use the concept of grouping and ordering of data.

 Implement Complex Queries

 Understand the concept of COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

**GROUP BY:**

There are circumstances where we would like to apply the aggregate function not only to

a single set of tuples, but also to a group of sets of tuples, we specify this in SQL using

the group by clause. The attribute or attributes given in the group by clause are used to

form group. Tuples with the same value on all attributes in the group by clause are placed

in one group.

**Syntax:**

SELECT columnname, columnname

FROM tablename

GROUP BY columnname;

**Example**:

SQL> SELECT EMPNO, SUM (SALARY) FROM EMP GROUP BY EMPNO;

**JOIN with GROUP BY:** This query is used to display a set of fields from two relations

by matching a common field in them and group the corresponding records for each and

every value of a specified key(s) while displaying.

**Syntax**: SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)

FROM relation_1,relation_2

WHERE relation_1.field_x=relation_2.field_y

GROUP BY field_z;

20**Example:**

SQL> SELECT empno,SUM(SALARY) FROM emp,dept WHERE emp.deptno =20

GROUP BY empno;

**GROUP BY - HAVING:** At times it is useful to state a condition that applies to groups

rather than to tuples. For example, we might be interested in only those employees where

the count of orders is more than 10. This condition does not apply to a single tuple, rather

it applies to each group constructed by the GROUP BY clause. HAVING clause is used

to handle such cases.

**Syntax:** SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)

FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value

GROUP BY column_name

HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) operator value;

**Example:**

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders

FROM (Orders INNER JOIN Employees ON

Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID)

GROUP BY LastName

HAVING COUNT (Orders.OrderID) > 10;

**ORDER BY:** This query is used to display a selected set of fields from a relation in an

ordered manner base on some field.

**Syntax:**

SELECT column_name

FROM table_name

ORDER BY column_name;

**Example:**

SQL> SELECT empno, ename, job

FROM emp

ORDER BY job;

**JOIN with ORDER BY**: This query is used to display a set of fields from two relations

by matching a common field in them in an ordered manner based on some fields.

21**Syntax:**

SELECT column_name1, column_name2

FROM relation_1, relation_2

WHERE relation_1.field_x = relation_2.field_y

ORDER BY field_z;

**Example:**

SQL> SELECT empno,ename,job,dname

FROM emp,dept

WHERE emp.deptno =dept.dept.no and emp.deptno = 20

ORDER BY job;

**WITH Clause:** The WITH clause may be processed as an inline view or resolved as a

temporary table. The advantage of the latter is that repeated references to the subquery

may be more efficient as the data is easily retrieved from the temporary table, rather than

being re-queried by each reference.

**Syntax:**

WITH <temporary table name> AS (

SELECT <attributes>

FROM <table name>

GROUP BY <attribute>)

SELECT <attribute/s> from <tablename/s>

**Example:**

WITH temporaryTable(averageValue) as

(SELECT avg(Salary) from Employee),

SELECT EmployeeID,Name, Salary from Employee

WHERE Employee.Salary > temporaryTable.averageValue;

**COMPLEX QUERIES** (Derived relations/Subqueries in the from Clause):

SQL allows a subquery expression to be used in the from clause. The key concept applied

here is that any select-from-where expression returns a relation as a result and, therefore,

can be inserted into another select-from-where anywhere that a relation can appear.

22**Example:**

select branch-name, avg-balance from (select branch-name, avg (balance) as avg-

balance from account group by branch-name) where avg-balance > 1200

**COMMIT AND ROLLBACK:**

Changes due to insert, update, and delete statements are temporarily stored in the

database system. They become permanent only after the COMMIT statement has been

issued.

 You can use the SQL ROLLBACK statement to rollback (undo) any changes

you made to the database before a COMMIT was issued.

 The SQL COMMIT statement saves any changes made to the database. When a

COMMIT has been issued, all the changes since the last COMMIT, or since you

logged on as the current user, are saved.

**Example:**

Implementing the save point

SQL> SAVEPOINT S23;

Save point created.

SQL> select * from employee;

SQL> INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(5,'Akalya','AP',1,10000);

1 row created.

SQL> select * from employee;

23Implementing the rollback

SQL> rollback;

SQL> select * from employee;

Implementing the commit

SQL> COMMIT;

Commit complete.

**LAB EXERCISE:**

Implement the following Queries on UNIVERSITY Database.

**Group By:**

1. Find the number of students in each course.

2. Find those departments where the average number of students are greater than 10.

3. Find the total number of courses in each department.

4. Find the names and average salaries of all departments whose average salary is

greater than 42000.

5. Find the enrolment of each section that was offered in Spring 2009.

**Ordering the display of Tuples (Use ORDER BY ASC/DESC):**

**PL/SQL BASICS**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to understand and use:

 PL/SQL anonymous block

 PL/SQL Conditional, Iterative and Sequential Control Statements

 Exception Handlers

**PL/SQL**

PL/SQL is the Oracle procedural extension of SQL. It is a portable, high-performance

transaction-processing language.

Though SQL is the natural language of Oracle DB, it has some disadvantages when used

as a programming language:

1. SQL does not have any procedural capabilities like condition checking, looping

2. 3. and branching.

SQL statements are passed on to the Oracle engine one at a time. This adds to the

network traffic in a multi-user environment and decreases data processing speed.

SQL has no facility for programmed error handling.

**Main Features of PL/SQL**

1. PL/SQL combines the data-manipulating power of SQL with the processing

power of procedural languages.

2. PL/SQL allows users to declare constants and variables, control program flow,

define subprograms, and trap runtime errors.

3. Complex problems can be broken into easily understandable subprograms, which

can be reused in multiple applications.

4. PL/SQL sends the entire block of SQL to the Oracle engine in one go, reducing

network traffic and leading to faster query processing.

5. Variables in PL/SQL blocks can be used to store intermediate result of a query for

later processing

32**PL/SQL Block Structure:** The basic unit of a PL/SQL source program is the block,

which groups related declarations and statements. The syntax for which is shown in

Figure 7.1

**COMPONENTS OF A PL/SQL BLOCK**

**1. DECLARE**

An optional declaration part in which variables, constants, cursors, and exceptions are

defined and possibly initialised.

**2. BEGIN …… END;**

A mandatory executable part consists of a set of SQL and PL/SQL statements. Data

manipulation, retrieval, looping and branching constructs are specified in this section.

**3. EXCEPTION**

An optional exception part deals with handling of errors that arise during execution of

data manipulation statements in the PL/SQL code block. Errors can arise due to syntax,

logic and**/**or validation rule violation.

**Example:** A PL/SQL block to display ‘Hello, World’.

declare

message varchar2(20):='Hello, World!';

begin

dbms_output.put_line(message);

end;

/

33‘SET SERVEROUTPUT ON’ command should be issued before executing the PL/SQL

block. Alternatively, it can be included in the beginning of every PL/SQL block.

**SQL DATA TYPES**

The default data types that can be declare in PL/SQL are

1. Number

2. Char

3. Date

4. Boolean

Null values are allowed for Number, Char and Date but not Boolean data type.

E.g.: sname varchar2(30);

**%TYPE**

PL/SQL can use %Type to declare variables based on column definition in a table. Hence,

if a column’s attribute changes, the variable’s attribute will change as well.

E.g.: sname student.name%TYPE;

**%ROWTYPE**

The %ROWTYPE attribute lets you declare a record that represents a row in a table or

view. For each column in the referenced table or view, the record has a field with the

same name and data type. To reference field in the record use _record_name_._field_name_.

The record fields do not inherit the constraints or default values of the corresponding

columns. If the referenced item table or view changes, your declaration is automatically

updated. You need not change your code when, for example, columns are added or

dropped from the table or view.

E.g., srecord student%ROWTYPE;

**Not Null:** ‘Not null’ causes creation of a variable or a constant that cannot be assigned

‘null’ value. Attempt to assign null value to such a variable or constant will return an

internal error.

**VARIABLES:** In PL/SQL a variable name must begin with a character with maximum

length of 30. Space not allowed in variable names. Reserve words cannot be used as

variable names unless enclosed within double quotes. Case is insignificant when

declaring variables.

**Values can be assigned to variables by:**

1. Using the assignment operator := (a colon followed by an ‘equal to’ ).

2. Selecting or fetching table data values INTO variables.

34**Constants** can be declared with constant keyword.

E.g.: pi constant number := 3.141592654;

**DISPLAYING USER MESSAGES ON SCREEN**

**dbms_output** is a package that includes procedures and functions that accumulate

information in a buffer so that it can be retrieved later.

**put_line** is a procedure in dbms_output package used to display information in the buffer.

SERVEROUTPUT should be set to ON before calling this procedure.

**COMMENTS**

Comment can be of two forms, as:

1. The comment line begins with a double hypen (--). The entire line is considered

as a comment.

2. The comment line begins with a slash followed by an asterisk (**/***) and ends with

asterisk followed by slash (***/**). All lines within is considered as comments.

**CONDITIONAL CONTROL: IF-THEN-ELSIF-ELSE-END IF**

**Syntax**:

IF < condition> THEN

< action >

ELSIF <condition> THEN

< action >

ELSE

< action >

END IF;

**Example:** A PL/SQL block to display the grade for given letter grade.

DECLARE

grade CHAR(1);

BEGIN

grade := '&g';

IF grade = 'A' THEN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Excellent');

ELSIF grade = 'B' THEN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Very Good');

ELSIF grade = 'C' THEN

35DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Good');

ELSIF grade = 'D' THEN

DBMS_OUTPUT. PUT_LINE('Fair');

ELSIF grade = 'F' THEN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Poor');

ELSE

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No such grade');

END IF;

END;

/

**ITERATIVE CONTROL: Simple Loop**

**Syntax**:

LOOP

<Sequence of statements>

END LOOP;

Once a loop begins to execute, it will go on forever. A conditional statement to control

the number of times loop executes should accompany the simple loop construct.

**Example:** The following PL/SQL block traces the control flow in a simple LOOP

construct.

DECLARE

x NUMBER := 0;

BEGIN

LOOP

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Inside loop: x = ' ||

TO_CHAR(x));

x := x + 1;

IF x > 3 THEN EXIT;

END IF;

END LOOP;

-- After EXIT, control resumes here

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' After loop: x = ' || TO_CHAR(x));

END;

36**Output**:

Inside loop: x = 0

Inside loop: x = 1

Inside loop: x = 2

Inside loop: x = 3

After loop: x = 4

**ITERATIVE CONTROL: While Loop**

**Syntax**:

WHILE <condition>

LOOP

<Action>

END LOOP;

**Example:** The following PL/SQL block traces the control flow in a while LOOP.

DECLARE

x NUMBER := 0;

BEGIN

WHILE x < 4

LOOP

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Inside loop: x = ' ||

TO_CHAR(x));

X := x + 1;

END LOOP

END;

/

**ITERATIVE CONTROL: For Loop**

**Syntax**:

FOR _index_ IN [ REVERSE ] lower_bound..upper_bound LOOP

statements

END LOOP ;

With REVERSE, the value of index starts at upper_bound and decreases by one with each

iteration of the loop until it reaches lower_bound.37**Example**: The following PL/SQL block traces the control flow in a FOR LOOP

BEGIN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('lower_bound < upper_bound');

FOR i IN 1..3 LOOP

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (i);

END LOOP;

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('lower_bound = upper_bound');

FOR i IN 2..2 LOOP

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (i);

END LOOP;

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('lower_bound > upper_bound');

FOR i IN 3..1 LOOP

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (i);

END LOOP;

END;

/

**Output**:

lower_bound < upper_bound

1

2

3

lower_bound = upper_bound

2

lower_bound > upper_bound

**SEQUENTIAL CONTROL: GOTO statement**

The GOTO statement transfers control to a label unconditionally. The label must be

unique in its scope and must precede an executable statement or a PL/SQL block. When

run, the GOTO statement transfers control to the labeled statement or block.

38**Syntax**:

GOTO _Label_

The code block is marked using tags

_<<Label>>_

**Example:** A PL/SQL block to check whether a given number is prime number.

DECLARE

p VARCHAR2(30);

n PLS_INTEGER := 37;

BEGIN

FOR j in 2..ROUND(SQRT(n)) LOOP

IF n MOD j = 0 THEN

p := ' is not a prime number';

GOTO print_now;

END IF;

END LOOP;

p := ' is a prime number';

<<print_now>>

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(TO_CHAR(n) || p);

END;

/

**ERROR HANDLING:**

In PL/SQL, a warning or error condition is called an _exception_. Exceptions can be

internally defined (by the run-time system) or user defined. Examples of internally

defined exceptions include _division by zero_ and _out of memory_ etc.

When an error occurs, an exception is _raised_. That is, normal execution stops and control

transfers to the exception-handling part of your PL/SQL block or subprogram. Internal

exceptions are raised implicitly (automatically) by the run-time system.

To handle raised exceptions, you write separate routines called _exception handlers_. After

an exception handler runs, the current block stops executing and the enclosing block

resumes with the next statement. If there is no enclosing block, control returns to the host

environment.

39**Syntax**:

EXCEPTION

WHEN _ex_name_1_ THEN

< Exception handler_1>

WHEN _ex_name_2_ OR _ex_name_3_ THEN

< Exception handler_2>

WHEN OTHERS THEN

< Exception handler_3>

END;

**Some pre-defined exceptions:**

**Exception** **Raised when ...**

DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX The program attempts to store duplicate values in a database

column that is constrained by a unique index.

NO_DATA_FOUND A SELECT INTO statement returns no rows

PROGRAM_ERROR PL/SQL has an internal problem.

TOO_MANY_ROWS A SELECT INTO statement returns more than one row.

VALUE_ERROR An arithmetic, conversion, truncation, or size-constraint error

occurs.

ZERO_DIVIDE The program attempts to divide a number by zero.

**Example**: Update all accounts with balance less than 0 to 0 in account(account_number,

balance) table, populated with {(1, 100); (2, 3000); (3, 500)}

DECLARE

BEGIN

update account set balance = 0 where balance<0

EXCEPTION

WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN dbms_output.put_line(“No rows

found”);

40END;

**User Defined Exceptions:**

User can define exceptions of his own in the declarative part of any PL/SQL block,

subprogram, or package. For example, an exception named insufficient_balance can

be defined to flag overdrawn bank accounts. Unlike internal exceptions, user-defined

exceptions _must_ be given names and they must be raised explicitly by RAISE statements.

**Example**: Validate the resultant balance before supporting withdrawal of money from

the account table such that a min. of 500 is maintained.

Declare

Insufficient_Balance Exception;

Amount account.balance%Type;

Temp account.balance%Type;

ANumber account.account_number%Type;

BEGIN

ANumber := &Number;

Amount := &Amount;

Select balance into Temp from account where

account_number = ANumber;

Temp := Temp – Amount;

IF (Temp >=500) THEN

update account set balance = Temp where account_number =

ANumber;

ELSE

RAISE Insufficient_Balanae;

EXCEPTION

WHEN Insufficient_Balance THEN

dbms_output.put_line(“Insufficient Balance”);

WHEN OTHERS THEN

dbms_output.put_line(“ERROR”);

END;

44**LAB NO: 8 Date:**

**CURSORS**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to understand and use:

 Implicit and Explicit Cursors

 Cursor For Loops, Parameterized Cursors

 Transactions

**CURSORS:** A cursor is a temporary work area created in the system memory when a

SQL statement is executed. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the

rows of data accessed by it. This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved

from the database, and manipulate this data. A cursor can hold more than one row, but

can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the active

set.

There are two kinds of cursors:

**Implicit Cursor**: A cursor that is constructed and managed by PL/SQL

**Explicit Cursor**: A cursor that the user constructs and manages.

1. 2. **Implicit Cursor**

Oracle engine implicitly opens a cursor on the server to process each SQL statement and

manages space, populates data and releases memory itself. Implicit cursor can be used to

access information about the status of last insert, update, delete or single row select

statements. SQL is the cursor name of the implicit cursor. The attributes of the implicit

cursor are listed below.

**Attribute Description**

**%FOUND** Returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement

affected one or more rows or a SELECT INTO statement

returned one or more rows. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

**%NOTFOUND** The logical opposite of %FOUND.

45**%ISOPEN** Always returns FALSE for implicit cursors, because Oracle

closes the SQL cursor automatically after executing its

associated SQL statement.

**%ROWCOUNT** Returns the number of rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE,

or DELETE statement, or returned by a SELECT INTO

statement.

**Example**: A PL/SQL block to delete the student records of History Department in

University database. Use implicit cursor attributes to check the success of delete

operation.

DECLARE

dname CONSTANT student.dept_name%TYPE := 'History';

BEGIN

DELETE FROM student WHERE dept_name = dname;

IF SQL%FOUND THEN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Delete succeeded for department:

'|| dname);

ELSE

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('No students of department: ' ||

dname);

END IF;

END;

/

**Output**: If there is no row that matches the delete query in _student_ table.

No students of department: History

**Explicit Cursor**

Steps involved in using an explicit cursor and manipulating data in its active set are:

1. Declare a cursor mapped to a select statement.

2. Open the Cursor.

3. Fetch data from the cursor one row at a time into memory variables

4. Process the data held in the memory variables as required using a loop

5. Exit from loop after processing is complete

6. Close the cursor

Cursor is defined in the declarative part.

**Syntax**:

CURSOR [ _parameter_list_ ] [ RETURN _return_type_ ]

IS _select_statement_;

OPEN _cursor_name_;

Loop

FETCH _cursor_name_ into _variable_list_;

End Loop

CLOSE _cursor_name;_

No memory is allocated at this point and only intimation is sent to the engine.

**Open** defines a private area named by the cursor name, executes the query , retrieves the

data and creates the Active Data Set.

**Fetch** moves the data held in the active data set into the memory variable. It is placed in

a Loop … End Loop which causes data to be fetched and processed until all rows are

processed

**Close** disables the cursor and the active data set becomes undefined. After the fetch loop

is executed the data needs to be closed. Close will release the memory occupied by the

cursor.

**Example**: A PL/SQL block to list the student names of ‘Comp. Sci.’ department in

University database.

DECLARE

dname CONSTANT student.dept_name%TYPE := ‘Comp. Sci.’;

CURSOR C1 is select name from Student where dept_name = dname;

sname student.name%TYPE;

BEGIN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( '-----------------------------------');

OPEN c1;

LOOP

-- Fetches student name into variable

FETCH c1 INTO sname;

47EXIT WHEN c1%NOTFOUND;

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( RPAD(‘Name: ‘ || sname);

END LOOP;

CLOSE c1;

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( '-----------------------------------');

END;

/

**CURSOR FOR LOOPS**

The cursor FOR LOOP statement lets the user run a SELECT statement and then

immediately loop through the rows of the result set. This statement can use either an

implicit or explicit cursor (but not a cursor variable).

The cursor FOR LOOP statement implicitly declares its loop index as a %ROWTYPE

record variable of the type that its cursor returns. This record is local to the loop and exists

only during loop execution. Statements inside the loop can reference the record and its

fields.

After declaring the loop index record variable, the FOR LOOP statement opens the

specified cursor. With each iteration of the loop, the FOR LOOP statement fetches a row

from the result set and stores it in the record. When there are no more rows to fetch, the

cursor FOR LOOP statement closes the cursor. The cursor also closes if a statement inside

the loop transfers control outside the loop or if PL/SQL raises an exception.

**Example**: A PL/SQL block to find the department having maximum Budget in

University database, without using max() aggregate function.

DECLARE

CURSOR C1 is select * from Department;

vBudget Department.Budget%Type :=0;

vdname Department.dept_name%TYPE;

BEGIN

For dept in C1

LOOP

IF dept.Budget > vBudget THEN

vBudget := dept.Budget;

vdname := dept.dept_name;

END IF;

END LOOP;

Dbms_output.put_line('Max. Budget: ' || vBudget || ' || vdname);

Dept: '

END;

48**WHERE CURRENT OF**

It states that the most recent row fetched from the table should be updated or deleted.

Inside a cursor loop, WHERE CURRENT OF allows the current row to be directly

updated. When the sessions open a cursor with the FOR UPDATE clause, all the rows in

the return set will hold row level locks. When SELECT FOR UPDATE is associated with

an explicit cursor, the cursor is called a FOR UPDATE cursor. Only a FOR UPDATE

cursor can appear in the CURRENT OF clause of an UPDATE or DELETE statement.

**Example**: A PL/SQL block to increase the Budget of different departments in University

database based upon current Budget. Increase the budget by 10%, 15% or 20% for the

ranges ‘greater than 100000’, ‘between 70000 and 100000’ or ‘less than or equal to

70000’, respectively.

DECLARE

CURSOR C1 is select * from Department for update;

BEGIN

For dept in C1

LOOP

IF dept.Budget <= 70000 THEN

update Department SET Budget = Budget*1.2 where current of C1;

ELSIF dept.Budget > 7000 and dept.Budget <= 100000 THEN

update Department SET Budget = Budget*1.15 where current of C1;

ELSE

update Department SET Budget = Budget*1.1 where current of C1;

END IF;

END LOOP;

END;

/

**PARAMATERIZED CURSORS**

PL/SQL allows parametrized cursor so that the cursor can be generic and the data that is

retrieved from the table be changed according to need. The user can create an explicit

cursor that has formal parameters, and then pass different actual parameters to the cursor

each time it is opened. In the cursor query, a formal cursor parameter can be used

anywhere that a constant is used. Outside the cursor query, formal cursor parameters

cannot be referenced.

**Syntax:**

CURSOR _cursor_name_( _variable_name_ Datatype) is SELECT statement

49**Example**: Based on the University database schema, the following example uses a

parametrized cursor on the Instructor table to display the instructors of given department.

DECLARE

cursor c(dname instructor.dept_name%TYPE) is select *

from Instructor where dept_name = dname;

BEGIN

FOR tmp IN c('Comp. Sci.')

LOOP

dbms_output.put_line('EMP_No: '||tmp.ID);

dbms_output.put_line('EMP_Name: '||tmp.name);

dbms_output.put_line('EMP_Dept: '||tmp.dept_name);

dbms_output.put_line('EMP_Salary:'||tmp.salary);

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( '-------------------------------');

END Loop;

END;

/

**TRANSACTIONS:**

A series of one or more statements that are logically related are termed as a Transaction.

A transaction begins with the first executable SQL statement after a commit, rollback or

connection made to the oracle engine. A transaction can be closed by using a commit or

a rollback statement.

**COMMIT** ends the current transaction and makes permanent changes made during the

transaction

**ROLLBACK** ends the transaction but undoes any changes made during the transaction

**SAVEPOINT** marks and saves the current point in the processing of a transaction.

**Syntax: Commit, Rollback & Savpoint**

COMMIT;

SAVEPOINT <_Savepointname_>

ROLLBACK TO <_Savepointname_>;

SAVEPOINT: Is optional and is used to rollback a transaction

partially as far as the specified savepoint

_Savepointname_: Is a savepoint created during the current

transaction

50ROLLBACK can be fired with or without the SAVEPOINT clause. Rollback operation

performed without the SAVEPOINT clause amounts to the following:

1. Ends the transaction

2. 3. Undoes all the changes in the current transaction

Erases all savepoints in that transaction

4. Releases the transactional locks

**Example:**

Consider account (account_number, balance) table, populated with {(1, 200); (2, 3000);

(3, 500)}. Withdraw an amount 200 and deposit 1000 for all the accounts. If the sum of

all account balance exceeds 5000 then undo the deposit just made.

Declare

Total_bal account.balance%TYPE;

Begin

Update account set balance=balance-200;

Savepoint deposit;

Update account set balance=balance+1000;

Select sum(balance) into total_bal from account;

If total_bal > 5000 then

Rollback to savepoint deposit;

End If;

Commit;

End;

**LAB EXERCISE:**

**Note:** Use University DB schema for the following, unless a different DB schema is

explicitly specified

**Cursors:**

**CursorName %ISOPEN / FOUND / NOT FOUND:**

1. The HRD manager has decided to raise the salary of all the Instructors in a given

department number by 5%. Whenever, any such raise is given to the instructor, a

record for the same is maintained in the salary_raise table. It includes the Instuctor

Id, the date when the raise was given and the actual raise amount. Write a PL/SQL

block to update the salary of each Instructor and insert a record in the salary_raise

table.

**salary_raise**(Instructor_Id, Raise_date, Raise_amt)

51**CursorName%ROWCOUNT:**

2. Write a PL/SQL block that will display the ID, name, dept_name and tot_cred of

the first 10 students with lowest total credit.

**Cursor For Loops:**

3. Print the Course details and the total number of students registered for each course

along with the course details - (Course-id, title, dept-name, credits,

instructor_name, building, room-number, time-slot-id, tot_student_no )

4. Find all students who take the course with Course-id: CS101 and if he/ she has

less than 30 total credit (tot-cred), deregister the student from that course. (Delete

the entry in Takes table)

**Where Current of:**

5. Alter StudentTable(refer Lab No. 8 Exercise) by resetting column LetterGrade to

F. Then write a PL/SQL block to update the table by mapping GPA to the

corresponding letter grade for each student.

**Parameterized Cursors:**

6. Write a PL/SQL block to print the list of Instructors teaching a specified course.

7. Write a PL/SQL block to list the students who have registered for a course taught

by his/her advisor.

**ADDITIONAL EXERCISE:**

**Cursors**

1. Write a PL/SQL block that will display the name, department and salary of the

top 10 highest paid instructors.

**Cursor For Loops:**

2. Repeat problem 1

i. Using cursor for loops. ii. Using where current of.

**Parameterized Cursors:**

523. Write a PL/SQL block that would update the Bal_stock in the item_master(ItemId,

Description, Bal_stock) table each time a transaction takes place with an entry in

the item_transaction (TransID, ItemId, Quantity) table. The change in the

item_master table depends on the itemId. If the item is present in the item_master

table then Bal_stock is updated. Otherwise, itemID is inserted into the

item_master table with ZERO as Bal_stock and raises an exception.

4. Write a PL/SQL block to find the number of courses offered and number of

students of each department. Use a parameterized cursor which takes department

name as a parameter and calculates the number of courses offered and number of

students of that department.

**Transactions: COMMIT / ROLLBACK / SAVEPOINT:**

5. Write a PL/SQL block that will insert a new record in Takes (ID, course-id, sec-

id, semester, year, grade) table. Check the total number of students registered for

the course and if it exceeds 30, then undo the insert made to the Takes table.

53**LAB NO.: 9 Date:**

**PROCEDURES, FUNCTIONS & PACKAGES**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Understand the different types of subprograms: Procedures and Function.

 Use Procedures and Functions to perform specific tasks.

 Understand the concept of Packages.

**Subprograms:** A PL/SQL subprogram is a named PL/SQL block that can be invoked

repeatedly. If the subprogram has parameters, their values can differ for each invocation.

PL/SQL has two types of subprograms:

1. **Procedure:** used to perform an action.

2. **Function:** to compute and return a value.

**Uses of Subprograms:**

• Modularity

• Easier Application Design

• Maintainability

• Packageability

• Reusability

• Better Performance

Since the stored subprograms run in the database server, a single invocation over the

network can start a large job.

**Part of a Subprogram:**

• Declarative part(optional)

• Executable part(required)

• Exception handling part(optional)

**PROCEDURE**

A procedure is a subprogram that performs a specific action. A procedure invocation (or

call) is a statement. In a procedure a return statement returns the control to the invoker

and we cannot specify any expression. The declarative part of a subprogram does not

begin with the keyword DECLARE, as the declarative part of an anonymous block does.

**Syntax:**

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameters list) 54

isBEGIN

//statements

END;

/

The procedure can be executed by just calling the procedure name with parameters in

other PL/SQL block. e.g.: procedure_name (actual values for the parameters);

**Example:** Create a procedure to print Hello world and execute the procedure.

create or replace procedure print_hello is

begin

dbms_output.put_line('Hello World');

end;

/

In another PL/SQL block procedure is called as shown below:

declare

begin

print_hello;

end;

/

**Output:**

Hello World

**FUNCTIONS**

A function has a same structure as a procedure except:

• A function must include a RETURN clause, which specifies the data type of the

value that the function returns (A procedure heading cannot have a RETURN

clause)

• In the executable part of a function, every execution path must lead to a

RETURN statement. Otherwise, the PL/SQL compiler issues a compile-time

warning.

**Syntax:**

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _function_name_(_variable_name_ datatype)

RETURN datatype

AS

//declare section

55BEGIN

…….

RETURN var2 //variable of the return datatype

END;

/

**Example 1:** Create a function to return the sum of two numbers

create or replace function sum_number(a number, b number)

return number as

tot number;

begin

tot := a + b;

return tot;

end;

/

**In another PL/SQL Block**

setserveroutput on;

declare

begin

end;

/

dbms_output.put_line(sum_number(5,4));

**Output:** 9

**Example 2:** A function that, given the name of a department, returns the count of the

number of instructors in that department. (Using University database schema)

create function dept count(dept name varchar)

returns integer

begin

declare d count integer;

select count(*) into d count

from instructor

where instructor.dept name= dept name

return d count;

end

56This function can be used in a query that returns names and budgets of all departments

with more than 12 instructors:

select dept name, budget

from instructor

where dept count(dept name) > 12;

**PACKAGES:** A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL types,

variables, constants, subprograms, cursors, and exceptions. A package is compiled and

stored in the database, where many applications can share its contents. It is a way of

creating generic, encapsulated, re-usable code.

**Components of an Oracle Package:**

A package has two components:

1. **A specification:** declares memory variables, constants, exceptions, cursors and

subprograms that are available in the package as public items.

2. **A body:** defines queries for public cursors and code for public subprograms. It can also

declare and define private items that cannot be referenced from outside the package. The

body can be changed without changing the specification or the references to the public

items.

**Features of Packages:**

**Modularity:** Packages encapsulates logically related types, variables, constants,

subprograms, cursors, and exceptions in named PL/SQL modules.

**Easier Application Design:** When designing an application, initially only the interface

information is required in the package specifications. The specifications can be coded and

compiled without their bodies.

**Information Hiding:** Packages lets the user share your interface information in the

package specification, and hide the implementation details in the package body.

**Added Functionality:** Package public variables and cursors can persist for the life of a

session. They can be shared by all subprograms that run in the environment. They allow

maintaining data across transactions without storing it in the database.

**Better Performance:** The first time when a package subprogram is invoked, Oracle

Database loads the whole package into memory. Subsequent invocations of other

subprograms in same the package require no disk I/O. Packages prevent cascading

dependencies and unnecessary recompiling.

**Easier to Grant Roles:** The user can grant roles on the package, instead of granting roles

on each object in the package.

57**Package Specification:** A package specification contains:

• Name of the package

• Names of the data types of any arguments

This declaration is local to the database and global to the package.

(Examples are based on the HR schema provided in the appendix.)

**Example:**

CREATE PACKAGE emp_bonus AS

PROCEDURE calc_bonus

(date_hiredemployees.hire_date%TYPE);

END emp_bonus;

/

**Package Body**

The body of the package contains the definition of public objects that are declared in the

specification. The body can also contain other object declaration that is private to the

package.

**Example:**

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY emp_bonus AS

PROCEDURE calc_bonus(date_hiredemployees.hire_date%TYPE) IS

BEGIN

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE

('Employees hired on ' || date_hired || 'get bonus.');

END;

END emp_bonus;

/

**Invoking a Package**

**Example:** Invoking the ‘calc_bonus’ procedure in ‘emp_bonus’ package

Execute emp_bonus. calc_bonus(“14-Jan-2012”);

[or]

Call emp_bonus. calc_bonus(“14-Jan-2012”);

**PL/SQL Subprogram Parameter Modes: IN, OUT, IN**

**Example:**

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE emp_mgmt AS

FUNCTION hire (last_name VARCHAR2, job_id VARCHAR2, manager_id

NUMBER,

salary NUMBER, commission_pct NUMBER, department_id

58NUMBER)

RETURN NUMBER;

FUNCTION create_dept(department_id NUMBER, location_id NUMBER)

RETURN NUMBER;

PROCEDURE remove_emp(employee_id NUMBER);

PROCEDURE remove_dept(department_id NUMBER);

PROCEDURE increase_sal(employee_id NUMBER, salary_incr

NUMBER);

PROCEDURE increase_comm(employee_id NUMBER, comm_incr

NUMBER);

no_comm EXCEPTION;

no_sal EXCEPTION;

END emp_mgmt;

/

The specification for the emp_mgmt package declares these public program objects:

• The functions hire and create_dept

• The procedures remove_emp, remove_dept, increase_sal, and increase_comm

• The exceptions no_comm and no_sal

**Package Body:**

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY emp_mgmt AS

FUNCTION hire (last_name VARCHAR2, job_id VARCHAR2, manager_id

NUMBER, salary NUMBER, commission_pct NUMBER, department_id

NUMBER)

RETURN NUMBER AS

//declare section

BEGIN

---------

RETURN var2 //variable of the return datatype

END;

/

FUNCTION create_dept(department_id NUMBER, location_id NUMBER)

RETURN NUMBER AS

//declare section

BEGIN

…….

RETURN var2 //variable of the return datatype

END;

59/

PROCEDURE remove_emp(employee_id NUMBER) is

BEGIN

……………

END;

END emp_mgmt;

/

**PL/SQL Subprogram Parameter Modes: IN, OUT, IN OUT:**

**Note:** Do not use OUT and IN OUT for function parameters. Ideally, a function takes

zero or more parameters and returns a single value. A function with IN OUT parameters

returns multiple values and has side effects. Regardless of how an OUT or IN OUT

parameter is passed:

60 If the subprogram exits successfully, then the value of the actual parameter is the

final value assigned to the formal parameter. (The formal parameter is assigned at

least one value—the initial value.)

 If the subprogram ends with an exception, then the value of the actual parameter

is undefined.

 Formal OUT and IN OUT parameters can be returned in any order. In this

example, the final values of x and y are undefined:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p (x OUT INTEGER, y OUT INTEGER)

AS

BEGIN

x := 17; y := 93;

END;

/

**Example 1:**

A procedure that, given the name of a department, returns the count of the number of

instructors in that department.

create procedure dept_count_proc(in dept_name varchar,

out d_count integer)

begin

select count(*) into d_count

from instructor

where instructor.dept_name= dept_count_proc.dept_name

end

Procedures can be invoked either from an SQL procedure or from embedded SQL by the

call statement:

declare d_count integer;

call dept_count_proc(’Physics’, d_count);

**Example 2:** The procedure p has two IN parameters, one OUT parameter, and one IN

OUT parameter. The OUT and IN OUT parameters are passed by value (the default). The

anonymous block invokes p twice, with different actual parameters. Before each

invocation, the anonymous block prints the values of the actual parameters. The

procedure p prints the initial values of its formal parameters. After each invocation, the

anonymous block prints the values of the actual parameters again.61CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p (

a PLS_INTEGER, -- IN by default

b IN PLS_INTEGER,

c OUT PLS_INTEGER,

d IN OUT BINARY_FLOAT

) IS

BEGIN

-- Print values of parameters:

66**LAB NO.: 10 Date:**

**TRIGGERS**

**Objectives:**

In this lab, student will be able to:

 Use triggers to enforce business logic in a database.

 Use Row triggers to enforce any constraint on a table.

 Understand the usage of “Instead Of” Triggers.

**Triggers**

A trigger is a named PL/SQL block that is stored in the database and run in response to

an event that occurs in the database. The user can specify the event (insert, update or

delete)

 whether the trigger fires before or after the event

 whether the trigger runs for each event or for each row affected by the event

**Uses of Triggers**

1. Enforce referential integrity constraints when child and parent tables are on different

nodes of the distributed database.

2. Prevent DML operations on a table after regular business hours.

3. Modify table data when DML statements are issued against views.

4. Enforce complex business rules that you cannot define with constraints.

**Triggers vs Constraints**

 A trigger applies on new data only while constraint holds true for the entire data

Eg.: a trigger can prevent a DML statement from inserting a NULL but the column

couldhave null prior.

 Constraints are easier to write and less error prone.

 But triggers can enforce complex business rules that constraints cannot.

**Syntax:**

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER _trigger_name_

BEFORE(AFTER) INSERT OR UPDATE OF _list of columns_

OR DELETE on _tablename_

FOR EACH ROW

begin

CASE

WHEN INSERTING THEN

//set of actions

67WHEN UPDATING(column1) THEN

//set of actions

WHEN DELETING THEN

//set of actions

END CASE;

END;

/

**:NEW AND :OLD**

 The trigger is fired when DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE

statements) are performed on the table.

 The user can choose what combination of operations should fire the trigger.

 Because the trigger uses BEFORE keyword, it can access the new values before

they go into the table, and can change the values if there is an easily-corrected

error

by assigning to :NEW.column_name.

 NEW.attribute is accessible on insertion and updation.

 OLD.attribute is accessible on deletion and updation.

**Example:** A trigger to insert the records into the emp_delete table before deleting the

records from the employee table, based on the HR schema provided in the appendix.

CREATE OR REPLACE trigger emp_trigger

BEFORE DELETE ON employee

FOR EACH ROW

BEGIN

insert into emp_delete values(:OLD.emp_id,

:OLD.emp_name,

:OLD.emp_sal);

END;

/

**Output:**

delete from employee where emp_id=1101;

When you execute the above statement in the terminal the same

record is inserted in the emp_delete table.

**INSTEAD OF TRIGGERS:**

 It is created to perform data manipulation of views which cannot be performed

ingeneral.

68 We cannot perform deletion or insertion on views if the view contains aggregate

functions or joins.

 An INSTEAD OF trigger is the only way to update a view that is not inherently

updatable.

 Consider a view which is joined on tables A and B. A delete operation on the view

is equivalent to deletion on A separately and B separately.

**Syntax:**

Create or replace trigger _trigger_name_

INSTEAD OF DELETE on _view_name_

FOR EACH ROW

BEGIN

//Set of Actions

END;

**EXERCISE:**

**Row Triggers**

1. Based on the University database Schema in Lab 2, write a row trigger that records

along with the time any change made in the Takes (ID, course-id, sec-id, semester,

year, grade) table in log_change_Takes (Time_Of_Change, ID, courseid,sec-id,

semester, year, grade).

2. Based on the University database schema in Lab: 2, write a row trigger to insert

the existing values of the Instructor (ID, name, dept-name, salary) table into a new

table Old_ Data_Instructor (ID, name, dept-name, salary) when the salary table is

updated.

**Database Triggers**

3. Based on the University Schema, write a database trigger on Instructor that checks

the following:

 The name of the instructor is a valid name containing only alphabets.

 The salary of an instructor is not zero and is positive

 The salary does not exceed the budget of the department to which the

instructor belongs.

4. Create a transparent audit system for a table Client_master (client_no, name,

address, Bal_due). The system must keep track of the records that are being

deleted or updated. The functionality being when a record is deleted or modified

the original record details and the date of operation are stored in the auditclient

(client_no, name, bal_due, operation, userid, opdate) table, then the delete or

update is allowed to go through.

69**Instead of Triggers**

5. Based on the University database Schema in Lab 2, create a view Advisor_Student

which is a natural join on Advisor, Student and Instructor tables. Create an

INSTEAD OF trigger on Advisor_Student to enable the user to delete the

corresponding entries in Advisor table.

**Additional Exercise:**

**Row Triggers**

1. Write a row trigger to update the Bal_Stock in item_master when a new

transaction is entered in the item_transaction

**Database Triggers**

2. Based on the Banking Schema provided in Appendix; write a database trigger on

Account that checks the following:

 The account for which transaction is performed is a valid account number

 The transaction amount is not zero and is positive

 In case of withdrawal, the amount does not exceed balance for that account

number

70**LAB NO.: 11 Date:**

**A SIMPLE APPLICATION USING ORACLE DB**

**Objectives:**

 To create a Java based database application using Oracle DB.

Three-tier architecture is an architectural deployment style that describe the separation of

functionality into layers with each segment being a tier that can be located on a physically

separate computer

Using this architecture, the software is divided into 3 different tiers: **_Presentation tier,_**

**_Logic tier, and Data tier_**. Each tier is developed and maintained as an independent tier.

**JDBC**

71An API that lets the user access virtually any tabular data source from the Java

programming language”. A tabular data source is virtually any data source, from

relational databases to spreadsheets and flat files.

**Basic steps to use a database in Java:**

1. Establish a connection

2. Create JDBC Statements

3. Execute SQL Statements

4. GET ResultSet

5. Close connections

**Example :**

The five basic steps are illustrated using an example.

**1. Establish a connection**

 import java.sql.*;

 Load the vendor specific driver

Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");Dynamically loads a driver class,

for Oracle database

 Make the connection

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-

prod:1521:OPROD", username, passwd);

 Establishes connection to database by obtaining a Connection object

**2. Create JDBC statement(s)**

 Create a Statement object for sending SQL statements to the database

Statement stmt = con.createStatement() ;

**3. Executing SQL Statements**

 String createLehigh = "Create table Lehigh " + "(SSN Integer not null, Name

VARCHAR(32), " + "Marks Integer)";

stmt.executeUpdate(createLehigh);

 String insertLehigh = "Insert into Lehigh values“ +"(123456789,abc,100)";

stmt.**executeUpdate**(insertLehigh);

**4. Get ResultSet**

72 String queryLehigh = "select * from Lehigh";

ResultSet rs = Stmt.executeQuery(queryLehigh);

while (rs.next()) {

int ssn = rs.getInt("SSN");

String name = rs.getString("NAME");

int marks = rs.getInt("MARKS");

}

**5. Close connection**

 stmt.close();

 con.close();

**Transactions and JDBC**

JDBC allows SQL statements to be grouped together into a single transaction.

Transaction control is performed by the Connection object, default mode is auto-commit,

I.e., each sql Statement is treated as a transaction. We can turn off the auto-commit mode

with

_con.setAutoCommit(false);_

And turn it back on with

_con.setAutoCommit(true);_

Once auto-commit is off, no SQL statement will be committed until an explicit is invoked

con.commit(); At this point all changes done by the SQL statements will be made

permanent in the database.

**Handling Errors with Exceptions**

Programs should recover and leave the database in a consistent state. If a statement in

the try block throws an exception or warning, it can be caught in one of the corresponding

catch statements. E.g., the user could rollback the transaction in a catch { …} block or

close database connection and free database related resources in finally {…} block.

**LAB EXERCISES:**

1. Consider the following tables of University database:73**Department** (dept-name, building, budget)

**Instructor**(ID, name, dept-name(Foreign key), salary)

Build the application containing the following screens which should cover the

functionalities of Insert, Update, Delete, etc. Handle “No Database Connectivity”

exception.

74**LAB NO.: 12** **Mini Project (Phase II)** **Date:**
