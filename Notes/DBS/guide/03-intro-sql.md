## Outline

- Overview of The SQL Query Language
- SQL Data Definition
- Basic Query Structure of SQL Queries
- Additional Basic Operations
- Set Operations
- Null Values
- Aggregate Functions
- Nested Subqueries
- Modification of the Database

---

## 3.1 History

- IBM **Sequel** language developed as part of System R project at the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory.
- Renamed **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.
- ANSI and ISO standard SQL:
  - SQL-86
  - SQL-89
  - SQL-92
  - SQL:1999 (language name became Y2K compliant!)
  - SQL:2003
- Commercial systems offer most, if not all, SQL-92 features, plus varying feature sets from later standards and special proprietary features.
  - Not all examples here may work on your particular system.

---

## 3.2 SQL Parts

- **DML** — provides the ability to query information from the database and to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and modify tuples in the database.
- **integrity** — the DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints.
- **View definition** — The DDL includes commands for defining views.
- **Transaction control** — includes commands for specifying the beginning and ending of transactions.
- **Embedded SQL and dynamic SQL** — define how SQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming languages.
- **Authorization** — includes commands for specifying access rights to relations and views.

---

## 3.3 Data Definition Language

The SQL data-definition language (DDL) allows the specification of information about relations, including:
- The schema for each relation.
- The type of values associated with each attribute.
- The Integrity constraints
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.
- Security and authorization information for each relation.
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.

### Domain Types in SQL
- **char(n).** Fixed length character string, with user-specified length $n$.
- **varchar(n).** Variable length character strings, with user-specified maximum length $n$.
- **int.** Integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine-dependent).
- **smallint.** Small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer domain type).
- **numeric(p,d).** Fixed point number, with user-specified precision of $p$ digits, with $d$ digits to the right of decimal point. (e.g., `numeric(3,1)` allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but not 444.5 or 0.32.)
- **real, double precision.** Floating point and double-precision floating point numbers, with machine-dependent precision.
- **float(n).** Floating point number, with user-specified precision of at least $n$ digits.
- More are covered in Chapter 4.

---

## 3.4 Create Table Construct

An SQL relation is defined using the `create table` command:
```sql
create table r
    (A1 D1, A2 D2, ..., An Dn,
     (integrity-constraint1),
     ...,
     (integrity-constraintk))
```
- $r$ is the name of the relation
- each $A_i$ is an attribute name in the schema of relation $r$
- $D_i$ is the data type of values in the domain of attribute $A_i$

**Example:**
```sql
create table instructor (
    ID         char(5),
    name       varchar(20),
    dept_name  varchar(20),
    salary     numeric(8,2))
```

### Integrity Constraints in Create Table
Types of integrity constraints:
- `primary key (A1, ..., An)`
- `foreign key (Am, ..., An) references r`
- `not null`

SQL prevents any update to the database that violates an integrity constraint.

**Example:**
```sql
create table instructor (
    ID         char(5),
    name       varchar(20) not null,
    dept_name  varchar(20),
    salary     numeric(8,2),
    primary key (ID),
    foreign key (dept_name) references department);
```

### And a Few More Relation Definitions
```sql
create table student (
    ID         varchar(5),
    name       varchar(20) not null,
    dept_name  varchar(20),
    tot_cred   numeric(3,0),
    primary key (ID),
    foreign key (dept_name) references department);

create table takes (
    ID         varchar(5),
    course_id  varchar(8),
    sec_id     varchar(8),
    semester   varchar(6),
    year       numeric(4,0),
    grade      varchar(2),
    primary key (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year),
    foreign key (ID) references student,
    foreign key (course_id, sec_id, semester, year) references section);
```

### And more still
```sql
create table course (
    course_id  varchar(8),
    title      varchar(50),
    dept_name  varchar(20),
    credits    numeric(2,0),
    primary key (course_id),
    foreign key (dept_name) references department);
```

### Updates to tables
- **Insert:**
  ```sql
  insert into instructor values ('10211', 'Smith', 'Biology', 66000);
  ```
- **Delete:** Remove all tuples from the *student* relation
  ```sql
  delete from student
  ```
- **Drop Table:**
  ```sql
  drop table r
  ```
- **Alter:**
  - `alter table r add A D` where $A$ is the name of the attribute to be added to relation $r$ and $D$ is the domain of $A$.
    - All existing tuples in the relation are assigned `null` as the value for the new attribute.
  - `alter table r drop A` where $A$ is the name of an attribute of relation $r$.
    - Dropping of attributes not supported by many databases.

---

## 3.5 Basic Query Structure

A typical SQL query has the form:
```sql
select A1, A2, ..., An
from r1, r2, ..., rm
where P
```
- $A_i$ represents an attribute
- $R_i$ represents a relation
- $P$ is a predicate.

The result of an SQL query is a relation.

---

## 3.6 The select Clause

The **select** clause lists the attributes desired in the result of a query.
- Corresponds to the projection operation of the relational algebra.

**Example:** find the names of all instructors:
```sql
select name
from instructor
```

**NOTE:** SQL names are case insensitive (i.e., you may use upper- or lower-case letters.)
- E.g., `Name ≡ NAME ≡ name`
- Some people use upper case wherever we use bold font.

### The select Clause (Cont.)
- SQL allows duplicates in relations as well as in query results.
- To force the elimination of duplicates, insert the keyword **distinct** after `select`.
- Find the department names of all instructors, and remove duplicates:
  ```sql
  select distinct dept_name
  from instructor
  ```
- The keyword **all** specifies that duplicates should not be removed.
  ```sql
  select all dept_name
  from instructor
  ```
  Result (with duplicates):
  ```
  dept_name
  ---------
  Comp. Sci.
  Finance
  Music
  Physics
  History
  Physics
  Comp. Sci.
  History
  Finance
  Biology
  Comp. Sci.
  Elec. Eng.
  ```

### The select Clause (Cont.) — asterisk and literals
- An asterisk in the select clause denotes "all attributes":
  ```sql
  select *
  from instructor
  ```
- An attribute can be a literal with no `from` clause:
  ```sql
  select '437'
  ```
  - Result is a table with one column and a single row with value "437"
  - Can give the column a name using:
    ```sql
    select '437' as FOO
    ```
- An attribute can be a literal with `from` clause:
  ```sql
  select 'A'
  from instructor
  ```
  - Result is a table with one column and $N$ rows (number of tuples in the *instructor* table), each row with value "A".

### The select Clause (Cont.) — arithmetic
The `select` clause can contain arithmetic expressions involving the operations `+`, `−`, `*`, and `/`, and operating on constants or attributes of tuples.
- The query:
  ```sql
  select ID, name, salary/12
  from instructor
  ```
  would return a relation that is the same as the *instructor* relation, except that the value of the attribute *salary* is divided by 12.
- Can rename "salary/12" using the `as` clause:
  ```sql
  select ID, name, salary/12 as monthly_salary
  ```

---

## 3.7 The where Clause

The `where` clause specifies conditions that the result must satisfy.
- Corresponds to the selection predicate of the relational algebra.

To find all instructors in Comp. Sci. dept:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
```

- SQL allows the use of the logical connectives **and**, **or**, and **not**.
- The operands of the logical connectives can be expressions involving the comparison operators `<, <=, >, >=, =, <>`.
- Comparisons can be applied to results of arithmetic expressions.

To find all instructors in Comp. Sci. dept with salary > 70000:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and salary > 70000
```

Result:
```
name
-----
Katz
Brandt
```

---

## 3.8 The from Clause

The `from` clause lists the relations involved in the query.
- Corresponds to the Cartesian product operation of the relational algebra.

Find the Cartesian product `instructor × teaches`:
```sql
select *
from instructor, teaches
```
- generates every possible instructor-teaches pair, with all attributes from both relations.
- For common attributes (e.g., `ID`), the attributes in the resulting table are renamed using the relation name (e.g., `instructor.ID`)

Cartesian product not very useful directly, but useful combined with `where`-clause condition (selection operation in relational algebra).

---

## 3.9 Examples

Find the names of all instructors who have taught some course and the course_id:
```sql
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID
```

Find the names of all instructors in the Art department who have taught some course and the course_id:
```sql
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID
  and instructor.dept_name = 'Art'
```

Sample result:
| name       | course_id |
|------------|-----------|
| Srinivasan | CS-101    |
| Srinivasan | CS-315    |
| Srinivasan | CS-347    |
| Wu         | FIN-201   |
| Mozart     | MU-199    |
| Einstein   | PHY-101   |
| El Said    | HIS-351   |
| Katz       | CS-101    |
| Katz       | CS-319    |
| Crick      | BIO-101   |
| Crick      | BIO-301   |
| Brandt     | CS-190    |
| Brandt     | CS-190    |
| Brandt     | CS-319    |
| Kim        | EE-181    |

---

## 3.10 The Rename Operation

The SQL allows renaming relations and attributes using the **as** clause:
```
old-name as new-name
```

Find the names of all instructors who have a higher salary than some instructor in 'Comp. Sci.':
```sql
select distinct T.name
from instructor as T, instructor as S
where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
```

Keyword `as` is optional and may be omitted:
```
instructor as T  ≡  instructor T
```

### Self Join Example
**Relation `emp-super`:**

| person | supervisor |
|--------|------------|
| Bob    | Alice      |
| Mary   | Susan      |
| Alice  | David      |
| David  | Mary       |

- Find the supervisor of "Bob"
- Find the supervisor of the supervisor of "Bob"
- Can you find ALL the supervisors (direct and indirect) of "Bob"?

---

## 3.11 String Operations

SQL includes a string-matching operator for comparisons on character strings. The operator `like` uses patterns that are described using two special characters:
- **percent ( % ).** The % character matches any substring.
- **underscore ( _ ).** The _ character matches any character.

Find the names of all instructors whose name includes the substring "dar":
```sql
select name
from instructor
where name like '%dar%'
```

Match the string "100%":
```
like '100 \%' escape '\'
```
in that above we use backslash (\\) as the escape character.

### String Operations (Cont.)
- Patterns are case sensitive.
- Pattern matching examples:
  - `'Intro%'` matches any string beginning with "Intro".
  - `'%Comp%'` matches any string containing "Comp" as a substring.
  - `'_ _ _'` matches any string of exactly three characters.
  - `'_ _ _ %'` matches any string of at least three characters.
- SQL supports a variety of string operations such as:
  - concatenation (using "||")
  - converting from upper to lower case (and vice versa)
  - finding string length, extracting substrings, etc.

---

## 3.12 Ordering the Display of Tuples

List in alphabetic order the names of all instructors:
```sql
select distinct name
from instructor
order by name
```

We may specify **desc** for descending order or **asc** for ascending order, for each attribute; ascending order is the default.
- Example: `order by name desc`

Can sort on multiple attributes:
- Example: `order by dept_name, name`

---

## 3.13 Where Clause Predicates

SQL includes a **between** comparison operator.

**Example:** Find the names of all instructors with salary between $90,000 and $100,000 (that is, ≥ $90,000 and ≤ $100,000):
```sql
select name
from instructor
where salary between 90000 and 100000
```

**Tuple comparison:**
```sql
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, 'Biology');
```

---

## 3.14 Set Operations

Find courses that ran in Fall 2017 or in Spring 2018:
```sql
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Fall' and year = 2017)
union
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Spring' and year = 2018)
```

Find courses that ran in Fall 2017 and in Spring 2018:
```sql
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Fall' and year = 2017)
intersect
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Spring' and year = 2018)
```

Find courses that ran in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018:
```sql
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Fall' and year = 2017)
except
(select course_id from section where sem = 'Spring' and year = 2018)
```

### Set Operations (Cont.)
- Set operations **union, intersect,** and **except**
  - Each of the above operations automatically eliminates duplicates.
- To retain all duplicates use the
  - **union all**,
  - **intersect all**
  - **except all**.

---

## 3.15 Null Values

- It is possible for tuples to have a null value, denoted by **null**, for some of their attributes.
- **null** signifies an unknown value or that a value does not exist.
- The result of any arithmetic expression involving **null** is **null**.
  - Example: `5 + null` returns `null`
- The predicate `is null` can be used to check for null values.
  - Example: Find all instructors whose salary is null.
    ```sql
    select name
    from instructor
    where salary is null
    ```
- The predicate `is not null` succeeds if the value on which it is applied is not null.

### Null Values (Cont.)
- SQL treats as **unknown** the result of any comparison involving a null value (other than predicates `is null` and `is not null`).
  - Example: `5 < null` or `null <> null` or `null = null`
- The predicate in a `where` clause can involve Boolean operations (`and`, `or`, `not`); thus the definitions of the Boolean operations need to be extended to deal with the value **unknown**.
  - **and:** `(true and unknown) = unknown`, `(false and unknown) = false`, `(unknown and unknown) = unknown`
  - **or:** `(unknown or true) = true`, `(unknown or false) = unknown`, `(unknown or unknown) = unknown`
- Result of `where` clause predicate is treated as *false* if it evaluates to *unknown*.

---

## 3.16 Aggregate Functions

These functions operate on the multiset of values of a column of a relation, and return a value:
- **avg:** average value
- **min:** minimum value
- **max:** maximum value
- **sum:** sum of values
- **count:** number of values

### Aggregate Functions Examples

Find the average salary of instructors in the Computer Science department:
```sql
select avg(salary)
from instructor
where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';
```

Find the total number of instructors who teach a course in the Spring 2018 semester:
```sql
select count(distinct ID)
from teaches
where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018;
```

Find the number of tuples in the *course* relation:
```sql
select count(*)
from course;
```

### Aggregate Functions — Group By

Find the average salary of instructors in each department:
```sql
select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
from instructor
group by dept_name;
```

| ID    | name       | dept_name  | salary |
|-------|------------|------------|--------|
| 76766 | Crick      | Biology    | 72000  |
| 45565 | Katz       | Comp. Sci. | 75000  |
| 10101 | Srinivasan | Comp. Sci. | 65000  |
| 83821 | Brandt     | Comp. Sci. | 92000  |
| 98345 | Kim        | Elec. Eng. | 80000  |
| 12121 | Wu         | Finance    | 90000  |
| 76543 | Singh      | Finance    | 80000  |
| 32343 | El Said    | History    | 60000  |
| 58583 | Califieri  | History    | 62000  |
| 15151 | Mozart     | Music      | 40000  |
| 33456 | Gold       | Physics    | 87000  |
| 22222 | Einstein   | Physics    | 95000  |

| dept_name  | avg_salary |
|------------|------------|
| Biology    | 72000      |
| Comp. Sci. | 77333      |
| Elec. Eng. | 80000      |
| Finance    | 85000      |
| History    | 61000      |
| Music      | 40000      |
| Physics    | 91000      |

### Aggregation (Cont.)
Attributes in `select` clause outside of aggregate functions must appear in `group by` list:
```sql
/* erroneous query */
select dept_name, ID, avg(salary)
from instructor
group by dept_name;
```

### Aggregate Functions — Having Clause
Find the names and average salaries of all departments whose average salary is greater than 42000:
```sql
select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
from instructor
group by dept_name
having avg(salary) > 42000;
```

**Note:** predicates in the `having` clause are applied **after** the formation of groups, whereas predicates in the `where` clause are applied **before** forming groups.

---

## 3.17 Nested Subqueries

SQL provides a mechanism for the nesting of subqueries. A **subquery** is a `select-from-where` expression that is nested within another query.

The nesting can be done in the following SQL query:
```sql
select A1, A2, ..., An
from r1, r2, ..., rm
where P
```
as follows:
- **From clause:** $r_i$ can be replaced by any valid subquery
- **Where clause:** $P$ can be replaced with an expression of the form:
  ```
  B <operation> (subquery)
  ```
  $B$ is an attribute and `<operation>` to be defined later.
- **Select clause:** $A_i$ can be replaced by a subquery that generates a single value.

---

## 3.18 Set Membership

Find courses offered in Fall 2017 and in Spring 2018:
```sql
select distinct course_id
from section
where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2017 and
    course_id in (select course_id
                  from section
                  where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018);
```

Find courses offered in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018:
```sql
select distinct course_id
from section
where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2017 and
    course_id not in (select course_id
                      from section
                      where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018);
```

### Set Membership (Cont.)
Name all instructors whose name is neither "Mozart" nor "Einstein":
```sql
select distinct name
from instructor
where name not in ('Mozart', 'Einstein')
```

Find the total number of (distinct) students who have taken course sections taught by the instructor with `ID` 10101:
```sql
select count(distinct ID)
from takes
where (course_id, sec_id, semester, year) in
    (select course_id, sec_id, semester, year
     from teaches
     where teaches.ID = 10101);
```

**Note:** Above query can be written in a much simpler manner. The formulation above is simply to illustrate SQL features.

---

## 3.19 Set Comparison — "some" Clause

Find names of instructors with salary greater than that of some (at least one) instructor in the Biology department.
```sql
select distinct T.name
from instructor as T, instructor as S
where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept_name = 'Biology';
```

Same query using `> some` clause:
```sql
select name
from instructor
where salary > some (select salary
                     from instructor
                     where dept_name = 'Biology');
```

### Definition of "some" Clause
$F\ \langle\text{comp}\rangle\ \text{some}\ r \iff \exists\ t \in r$ such that $F\ \langle\text{comp}\rangle\ t$.
Where `<comp>` can be: $<, \le, >, =, \ne$.

Examples:
- `(5 < some {0, 5, 6}) = true` (read: 5 < some tuple in the relation)
- `(5 < some {0, 5}) = false`
- `(5 = some {0, 5}) = true`
- `(5 ≠ some {0, 5}) = true` (since 0 ≠ 5)
- `(= some) ≡ in`
- However, `(≠ some) ≢ not in`

---

## 3.20 Set Comparison — "all" Clause

Find the names of all instructors whose salary is greater than the salary of all instructors in the Biology department.
```sql
select name
from instructor
where salary > all (select salary
                    from instructor
                    where dept_name = 'Biology');
```

### Definition of "all" Clause
$F\ \langle\text{comp}\rangle\ \text{all}\ r \iff \forall\ t \in r\ (F\ \langle\text{comp}\rangle\ t)$.

Examples:
- `(5 < all {0, 5, 6}) = false`
- `(5 < all {6, 10}) = true`
- `(5 = all {4, 5}) = false`
- `(5 ≠ all {4, 6}) = true` (since 5 ≠ 4 and 5 ≠ 6)
- `(≠ all) ≡ not in`
- However, `(= all) ≢ in`

---

## 3.21 Test for Empty Relations

The `exists` construct returns the value **true** if the argument subquery is nonempty.
- `exists r ⇔ r ≠ ∅`
- `not exists r ⇔ r = ∅`

### Use of "exists" Clause
Yet another way of specifying the query "Find all courses taught in both the Fall 2017 semester and in the Spring 2018 semester":
```sql
select course_id
from section as S
where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2017 and
    exists (select *
            from section as T
            where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018
              and S.course_id = T.course_id);
```

- **Correlation name** — variable `S` in the outer query
- **Correlated subquery** — the inner query

### Use of "not exists" Clause
Find all students who have taken all courses offered in the Biology department.
```sql
select distinct S.ID, S.name
from student as S
where not exists ((select course_id
                   from course
                   where dept_name = 'Biology')
                  except
                  (select T.course_id
                   from takes as T
                   where S.ID = T.ID));
```

- First nested query lists all courses offered in Biology
- Second nested query lists all courses a particular student took
- Note that $X - Y = \emptyset \iff X \subseteq Y$
- **Note:** Cannot write this query using `= all` and its variants

---

## 3.22 Test for Absence of Duplicate Tuples

The `unique` construct tests whether a subquery has any duplicate tuples in its result.
- The `unique` construct evaluates to "true" if a given subquery contains no duplicates.

Find all courses that were offered at most once in 2017:
```sql
select T.course_id
from course as T
where unique (select R.course_id
              from section as R
              where T.course_id = R.course_id
                and R.year = 2017);
```

---

## 3.23 Subqueries in the From Clause

SQL allows a subquery expression to be used in the `from` clause.

Find the average instructors' salaries of those departments where the average salary is greater than $42,000.
```sql
select dept_name, avg_salary
from (select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
      from instructor
      group by dept_name)
where avg_salary > 42000;
```

Note that we do not need to use the `having` clause.

Another way to write the above query:
```sql
select dept_name, avg_salary
from (select dept_name, avg(salary)
      from instructor
      group by dept_name)
       as dept_avg(dept_name, avg_salary)
where avg_salary > 42000;
```

## 3.24 With Clause

The `with` clause provides a way of defining a temporary relation whose definition is available only to the query in which the `with` clause occurs.

Find all departments with the maximum budget:
```sql
with max_budget(value) as
    (select max(budget)
     from department)
select department.name
from department, max_budget
where department.budget = max_budget.value;
```

### Complex Queries using With Clause
Find all departments where the total salary is greater than the average of the total salary at all departments:
```sql
with dept_total(dept_name, value) as
    (select dept_name, sum(salary)
     from instructor
     group by dept_name),
dept_total_avg(value) as
    (select avg(value)
     from dept_total)
select dept_name
from dept_total, dept_total_avg
where dept_total.value > dept_total_avg.value;
```

## 3.25 Scalar Subquery

Scalar subquery is one which is used where a single value is expected.

List all departments along with the number of instructors in each department:
```sql
select dept_name,
    (select count(*)
     from instructor
     where department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name)
    as num_instructors
from department;
```

Runtime error if subquery returns more than one result tuple.

## 3.26 Modification of the Database

- Deletion of tuples from a given relation.
- Insertion of new tuples into a given relation.
- Updating of values in some tuples in a given relation.

### Deletion

Delete all instructors:
```sql
delete from instructor
```

Delete all instructors from the Finance department:
```sql
delete from instructor
where dept_name = 'Finance';
```

Delete all tuples in the *instructor* relation for those instructors associated with a department located in the Watson building.
```sql
delete from instructor
where dept_name in (select dept_name
                    from department
                    where building = 'Watson');
```

### Deletion (Cont.)
Delete all instructors whose salary is less than the average salary of instructors:
```sql
delete from instructor
where salary < (select avg(salary)
                from instructor);
```

- **Problem:** as we delete tuples from *instructor*, the average salary changes.
- **Solution used in SQL:**
  1. First, compute `avg(salary)` and find all tuples to delete.
  2. Next, delete all tuples found above (without recomputing `avg` or retesting the tuples).

### Insertion

Add a new tuple to *course*:
```sql
insert into course
values ('CS-437', 'Database Systems', 'Comp. Sci.', 4);
```

or equivalently:
```sql
insert into course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
values ('CS-437', 'Database Systems', 'Comp. Sci.', 4);
```

Add a new tuple to *student* with `tot_creds` set to null:
```sql
insert into student
values ('3003', 'Green', 'Finance', null);
```

### Insertion (Cont.)
Make each student in the Music department who has earned more than 144 credit hours an instructor in the Music department with a salary of $18,000.
```sql
insert into instructor
    select ID, name, dept_name, 18000
    from student
    where dept_name = 'Music' and total_cred > 144;
```

The `select from where` statement is evaluated fully **before** any of its results are inserted into the relation. Otherwise queries like:
```sql
insert into table1 select * from table1
```
would cause problem.

### Updates

Give a 5% salary raise to all instructors:
```sql
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.05
```

Give a 5% salary raise to those instructors who earn less than 70000:
```sql
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.05
where salary < 70000;
```

Give a 5% salary raise to instructors whose salary is less than average:
```sql
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.05
where salary < (select avg(salary)
                from instructor);
```

### Updates (Cont.)
Increase salaries of instructors whose salary is over $100,000 by 3%, and all others by 5%.

Write two `update` statements:
```sql
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.03
where salary > 100000;
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.05
where salary <= 100000;
```

- The order is important.
- Can be done better using the `case` statement (next slide).

### Case Statement for Conditional Updates
Same query as before but with `case` statement:
```sql
update instructor
set salary = case
    when salary <= 100000 then salary * 1.05
    else salary * 1.03
end
```
